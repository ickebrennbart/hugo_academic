<!--**Leuven.AI Stories - AI Blog &#x2200; & <span style="color: orange;">None</span>**-->
**Leuven.AI Stories** is a collection of blog posts as well as audio and video content related to education and research on artificial intelligence at the KU Leuven. It is intended as a space that bridges the gap between the deep theoretical and technological expertise of our AI researchers on the one hand, and people from industry and society - with or without AI expertise - on the other hand. *Leuven.AI Stories* presents research results and interesting developments in AI outside the standard scientific outlets. The content, therefore, puts an emphasis on making research and research results more accessible, including the broader contextualisation of specific research objectives to highlight their more immediate relevance to society as a whole.

We encourage all KU Leuven researchers, especially early career researchers, to write up their latest research results, emerging trends, expert opinions, etc. for *Leuven.AI Stories*. For any inquiries about potential stories or to submit your article, audio or video, please send an email to [Jens Bürger](/stories/author/jens-burger).

Editor: Jens Bürger


Editorial guidelines for submitting content:
- Blog posts
  - Content can be derived from a recent publication, a summary of a conference or workshop, a lecture series or anything that contributed to the advancement of AI.
  - The length of blog posts should be between 1000-2000 words or roughly 5 minutes reading time.
  - The articles should be written for a broader audience, including non-AI experts.
  - Articles should use self-explanatory figures to support the comprehension of the main ideas.
- Audio-Visual content
  - We are interested in publishing demonstrations of research outcomes or interviews, conversations and opinions of our senior Leuven.AI members.
  - Topics could include:
    - Discussion of important development in AI over the last years.
    - Expectations of future AI developments, including potentials and risks.
    - Controversies between different experts.
  - Just as for the blog posts, attention should also be given to being accessible to a broad audience
  - There are no length limits, but it should be kept concise.
  - If you have questions whether or not a certain topic or idea might be suitable, feel free to send us an email.

#### AI blog &#x2200; & <span style="color: orange;">None</span>?
The curious reader might have wondered about the subtitle of Leuven.AI Stories - *AI blog &#x2200; & None*. This, somewhat playful subtitle, expresses two ideas:

First, it captures interdisciplinarity, which is at the heart of Leuven.AI:

1. It is an **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence **blog**;
2. the notation **&#x2200; (for all)** represents the mathematical foundations of AI;
3. the logical operator **&** points to foundations in logic;
4. the python construct **None** represents programming languages, and
5. all together, it adopts the subtitle of Nietzsche's *Thus Spoke Zarathustra - A book for all and none* to highlight AI's foundation in philosophy.

Second, with the *&#x2200; & None* we want to acknowledge the difficult, yet very important issue of communicating AI effectively to a wide audience. While it is fair to say that Leuven.AI Stories is slightly less ambitious than what Nietzsche had in mind for Zarathustra, the subtitle shall make us reflect on what and who we do AI research for and to keep in mind the philosophical, ethical, and societal implications of our technological achievements.
