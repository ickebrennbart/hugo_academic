I am motivated by exploring topics in the larger context they are embedded in and by creating interesting synergies at the intersection of technology and society. This led me to Leuven.AI where I focus on the strengthening and articulation of interdiscplinary and collaborative AI projects between our members as well as in collaboration with industrial and societal partners. I consider Leuven.AI stories as an effort to make our AI research at Leuven.AI more relatable and thus more meaningful to a wide range of people interested in technological developments in AI.
