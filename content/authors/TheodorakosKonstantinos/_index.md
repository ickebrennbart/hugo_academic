I worked as an Electronic Hardware Technician from 2008 to 2011 and as a Numerics Software Developer for Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning on Geographic Information Systems from 2013 to 2018. I am currently working on time series analysis and modelling in data science application areas, including health 2.0 and industry 4.0 environments. My dream is that one day we will be able to create beneficial, ethical and explainable Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
