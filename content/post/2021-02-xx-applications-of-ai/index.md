AI research at KU Leuven has a long tradition, with first research projects and advanced educational programs starting more then three decades ago. The breadth of research of Leuven.AI members covers almost all foundational areas of AI. However, an equally strong position is held in the driving AI into concrete applications across many disciplines. Here, we will give a short, non-exhaustive A to Z of AI applications at Leuven.AI.

__Autonomous driving:__

By now, autonomous vehicles are probably among the most notorious application of AI. Especially the team around Luc Van Gool is developing advanced computer vision systems to equip future vehicles with the necessary visiual perception of diverse, complex, and dense human-build environments.

Automatic image translation (AIT) to generate additional scenes from existing images. E.g., take an image taken at good weather conditions and generate the same image content, but with bad weather such as rain or fog. The availability of diverse datasets that can capture the full scope of possible visual scenarios is essential to develop robust and safe computer vision systems for autonomous vehicles.
